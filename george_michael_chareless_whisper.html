      <p><h4>Intro</h4><br /></p>
        <p>
            I feel so unsure<br>
            As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor<br>
            As the music dies, something in your eyes<br>
            Calls to mind a silver screen<br>
            And all its sad good-byes <br>           
        </p><br/>
        <p>
            <b>Reff</b><br/>
            I'm never gonna dance again<br>
            Guilty feet have got no rhythm<br>
            Though it's easy to pretend<br>
            I know you're not a fool<br><br/>
            I should've known better than to cheat a friend<br>
            And waste the chance that I'd been given<br>
            So I'm never gonna dance again<br>
            The way I danced with you, oh<br>
        </p><br/>
        <p><b>Intro</b></p><br/>
      <p>
        Time can never mend<br>
        The careless whispers of a good friend<br>
        To the heart and mind<br>
        Ignorance is kind<br>
        There's no comfort in the truth<br>
        Pain is all you'll find
      </p><br/>
      <p>Back to : <b>Reff</b></p><br/>
      <p><b>Interlude</b></p>
      <p>(Never without your love)</p><br/>
      <p>
        Tonight the music seems so loud<br>
        I wish that we could lose this crowd<br>
        Maybe it's better this way<br>
        We'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say<br><br/>
        We could have been so good together<br>
        We could have lived this dance forever<br>
        But now, who's gonna dance with me?<br>
        Please stay<br>
      </p><br/>
      <p>Back to : <b>Reff</b></p><br/>
      <p><h4>Coda</h4><br /></p>
      <p>
        now that you're gone<br>
        (Now that you're gone) <br>
        was what I did so wrong, so wrong<br>
        That you had to leave me alone?<br>
