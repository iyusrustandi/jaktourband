            I know that she's waiting<br>
            For me to say forever<br>
            I know that I sometimes<br>
            Just don't know how to tell her<br>
        </p><br/>
        <p>
            I want to hold and kiss her<br>
            Give her my love<br>
            Make her believe<br>
            'Cause she doesn't know<br>
            She doesn't know<br>

            <h4>Reff</h4>
            You're all I need beside me girl<br>
            You're all I need to turn my world<br>
            You're all I want inside my heart<br>
            You're all I need when we're apart <br>    
            <br>
            You're all that I need, yeah  <br>

            I know that she's always<br>
            There when I need her loving<br>
            I know that I've never<br>
            Told her how much I love her<br>
            <br>
            I see her face before me<br>
            I look in her eyes<br>
            Wondering why<br>
            She doesn't know<br>
            She doesn't know<br>
            <br>
            She doesn't know...<br>

            Whenever I reach out<br>

            Stay, stay within my heart<br>
