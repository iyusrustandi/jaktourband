<!-- ================================= Verse ====================================== -->
        <p>
        Where do I begin<br>
        To tell the story of how great a love can be<br>
        The sweet love story that is older than the sea<br>
        The simple truth about the love she brings to me<br>
        Where do I start<br>
            <br>
        With her first hello<br>
        She gave new meaning to this empty world of mine<br>
        There'd never be another love, another time<br>
        She came into my life and made the living fine<br>
        She fills my heart<br>
        </p><br/><br/>

<!-- ================================= Reff ====================================== -->
        <div class="reff">
            <h4>Reff</h4>
           She fills my heart with very special things<br>
            With angels' songs, with wild imaginings<br>
            She fills my soul with so much love<br>
            That anywhere I go I'm never lonely<br>
            With her around, who could be lonely<br>
            I reach for her hand, it's always there<br>
        </div><br/><br/>

   <p>
       How long does it last<br>
        Can love be measured by the hours in a day<br>
        I have no answers now but this much I can say<br>
        I know I'll need her 'til the stars all burn away<br>
        And she'll be there<br>
        <br>
