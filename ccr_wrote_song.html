    <div class="lyric">
      <p><h4>Intro</h4><br /></p>
      <p>
        Met myself a-coming, county welfare line<br>
        I was feeling strung out, hung out on the line<br>
        Saw myself a-going down to war in June<br>
        All I want, all I want is to write myself a tune<br>  
        </p><br/>    
      <p>
        <b>Reff</b><br/>
        Wrote a song for everyone<br>
        Wrote a song for truth<br>
        Wrote a song for everyone<br>
        When I couldn't even talk to you<br>
      </p><br />
      <p><h4>Intro</h4><br /></p>
      <p>
        Got myself arrested, wound me up in jail<br>
        Richmond about to blow up, communication failed<br>
        If you see the answer, now's the time to say<br>
        All I want, all I want is to get you down to pray<br>
    </p><br/>
      <p>Back To : <b>Reff</b></p><br/>
      <p><b>Interlude</b></p><br/>
      <p>Back To : <b>Reff</b></p><br/>
      <p>
        Saw the people standing, thousand years in chains<br>
        Somebody said it's different now, look it's just the same<br>
        Pharaohs spin the message, round and round the truth<br>
        They could have saved a million people, how can I tell you?<br>
      </p><br/>
      <p>Back To : <b>Reff (3X)</b></p><br/>
      <p><b>Coda</b></p><br/>
