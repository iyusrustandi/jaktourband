Someone told me long ago, there's a calm before the storm,
   F                         Bb
I know, it's been comin' for some time.
Bb
When it's over, so they say, it'll rain a sunny day,
   F                        Bb 
I know, shinin' down like water.

Yesterday and days before,Sun is cold and rain is hard,
