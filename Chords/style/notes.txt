Baby lock the door and turn the  lights down low 
                                        F# 
Put some music on that's  soft and slow 
                                 C# 
Baby we ain't got no place to go 
                             F# 
I hope you under  stand   STOP

I've been thinking 'bout this all day long 
                              F# 
Never felt a feeling quite this strong 
                                       C# 
I can't believe how much it turns me on 
	        F# 
Just to be your man
