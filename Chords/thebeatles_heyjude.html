          Hey Jude, don't make it bad.<br />

          Then you can start to make it better. <br />
          <br />
          Hey Jude, don't be afraid.<br />
          You were made to go out and get her.<br />

          And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain,<br />
          Don't carry the world upon your shoulders.<br />
          For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool<br />
          By making his world a little colder.<br />
