          <p><b>Intro</b></p>
        </div>

        <div class="verse">
          Where do I begin<br />
          To tell the story of how great a love can be<br />
          The sweet love story that is older than the sea<br />
          The simple truth about the love she brings to me<br />
          Where do I start<br />
          <br />
          With her first hello<br />
          She gave new meaning to this empty world of mine<br />
          There'd never be another love, another time<br />
          She came into my life and made the living fine<br />
          She fills my heart<br />
        </div>

        <div class="reff">
          <b>Reff</b><br />
          She fills my heart with very special things<br />
          With angels' songs, with wild imaginings<br />
          She fills my soul with so much love<br />
          That anywhere I go I'm never lonely<br />
          With her around, who could be lonely<br />
          I reach for her hand, it's always there<br />
        </div>

        <div class="verse">
          How long does it last<br />
          Can love be measured by the hours in a day<br />
          I have no answers now but this much I can say<br />
          I know I'll need her 'til the stars all burn away<br />
          And she'll be there<br />
          <br />
          How long does it last<br />

          I know I'll need her 'til the stars all burn away<br />
