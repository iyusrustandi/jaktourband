          Something in the way she moves<br />
          Attracts me like no other lover<br />
          Something in the way she woos me<br />
          <br />
          I don't want to leave her now<br />
          You know I believe and how<br />
          <br />
          Somewhere in her smile she knows<br />
          That I don't need no other lover<br />
          Something in her style that shows me<br />
          <br />
          I don't want to leave her now<br />
          You know I believe and how<br />
          <br />
          You're asking me will my love grow<br />
          I don't know, I don't know<br />
          <br />
          You stick around, now it may show<br />
          I don't know, I don't know<br />
