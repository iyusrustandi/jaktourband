    <h2>Bonjovi - Bed Of Roses</h2>
    <div class="lyric">
      <p><h4>Intro</h4><br /></p>
      <p>
        Sitting here wasted and wounded<br>
        At this old piano<br>
        Trying hard to capture<br>
        The moment this morning I don't know    <br>    
      </p><br />
      <p>
        'Cause a bottle of Vodka's still lodged in my head<br>
        And some blonde gave me nightmares<br>
        Think that she's still in my bed<br>
        As I dream about movies<br>
        They won't make of me when I'm dead  <br>        
      </p><br />
      <p>
        With an ironclad fist<br>
        I wake up and french kiss the morning<br>
        While some marching band keeps its own beat in my head<br>
        While we're talking     <br>
      </p><br />
      <p>
        About all of the things that I long to believe<br>
        About love, the truth, what you mean to me<br>
        And the truth is<br>
        Baby you're all that I need       <br>
      </p><br />
      <p>
        <b>Reff</b><br/>
        I want to lay you down in a bed of roses<br>
        For tonight I'll sleep on a bed of nails<br>
        Oh I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is<br>
        And lay you down on a bed of roses<br>
      </p><br />
      <p>
        Well I'm so far away<br>
        Each step that I take is on my way home<br>
        A king's ransom in dimes, I'd give each night<br>
        To see through this payphone    <br>      
      </p><br />
      <p>
        Still I run out of time<br>
        Or it's hard to get through<br>
        Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you<br>
        I'll just close my eyes and whisper<br>
        "Baby, blind love is true"     <br>
      </p><br />
      <p>Back To : <b>Reff</b></p><br/>
      <p>
        <b>Bridge</b><br/>
        Well this hotel bar's hangover whiskey's gone dry<br>
        The barkeeper's wig's crooked<br>
        And she's giving me the eye<br>
        Well I might have said yeah<br>
        But I laughed so hard I think I died<br>
        Ooh yeah<br>
      </p><br />
      <p><h4>Interlude</h4><br /></p>
      <p>
        Now as you close your eyes<br>
        Know I'll be thinking about you<br>
        While my mistress she calls me<br>
        To stand in her spotlight again<br>
      </p><br />
      <p>
        Tonight I won't be alone<br>
        But you know that don't mean I'm not lonely<br>
        I've got nothing to prove<br>
        For it's you that I'd die to defend<br>
      </p><br />
