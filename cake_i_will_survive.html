      <p><h4>Intro</h4><br /></p>
      <p>
        At first I was afraid<br>
        I was petrified<br>
        I kept thinking I could never live without you<br>
        By my side<br>
        </p><br/>    
        <p>
        But then I spent so many nights<br>
        Just thinking how you've done me wrong<br>
        I grew strong<br>
        I learned how to get along<br>
        </p><br/>
        <p>
        And so you're back<br>
        From outer space<br>
        I just walked in to find you<br>
        Here with that look upon your face<br>
        </p><br/>    
        <p>
        I should have changed my fucking lock<br>
        I would have made you leave your key<br>
        If I had known for just one second<br>
        You'd be back to bother me<br>
        </p><br/>
      <p>
        <b>Reff</b><br/>
        Oh now go<br>
        Walk out the door<br>
        Just turn around<br>
        Now, you're not welcome anymore<br>
      </p><br />
      <p>
        Weren't you the one<br>
        Who tried to break me with desire?<br>
        Did you think I'd crumble?<br>
        Did you think I'd lay down and die?     <br>   
      </p><br/>
      <p>
        Oh not I, I will survive<br>
        Yeah<br>
        As Long as I know how to love<br>
        I know I'll be alive
      </p><br/>
      <p>I've got all my life to live<br>
        I've got all my love to give<br>
        I will survive, I will survive<br>
        Yeah, yeah<br>
        </p> <br/>
      <p><b>Interlude</b></p><br/>
      <p>
        It took all the strength I had<br>
        Just not to fall apart<br>
        I'm trying hard to mend the pieces<br>
        Of my broken heart<br>
      </p><br/>
      <p>
        And I spent oh so many nights<br>
        Just feeling sorry for myself<br>
        I used to cry<br>
        But now I hold my head up high<br>
      </p><br/>
      <p>
        And you see me<br>
        With somebody new<br>
        I'm not that stupid little person<br>
        Still in love with you<br>
      </p><br/>
      <p>
        And so you thought you'd just drop by<br>
        And you expect me to be free<br>
        But now I'm saving all my lovin'<br>
        For someone who's lovin' me<br>
      </p><br/>
