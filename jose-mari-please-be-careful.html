    <h2>Jose Mari Chan Ft. Regine Velasquez - Please Be Careful With My Heart</h2>
    <div class="lyric">
      <p><h4 class="guide">Intro</h4><br /></p>
      <p>
        If you love me like you tell me, please be careful with my heart<br>
        You can take it, just don't break it or my world will fall apart<br>
      </p><br /><br/>
      <div class="reff">
        <h4>Reff</h4>
        You are my first romance and I'm willing to take a chance<br>
        That 'til life is through, I'll still be loving you<br>
        I will be true to you, just a promise from you will do<br>
        From the very start please be careful with my heart<br> 
      </div><br/><br/>
      <p>
        I love you and you know, I do there'll be no one else for me<br>
        Promise I'll be always true for the world and all to see<br>
        Love has heard some lies softly spoken<br>
        And I have had my heart badly broken<br>
        I've been burned and I've been hurt before<br>
        <br>
        So I know just how you feel, trust my love is real for you<br>
        I'll be gentle with your heart, I'll caress it like the morning dew<br>
        I'll be right beside you forever, I won't let your world fall apart<br>
        From the very start, I'll be careful with your heart<br>
      </p><br /><br/>

        From the very start (from the very start)<br>
        From the very start (from the very start)<br>
        From the very start,<br> 
        please be careful with (I'll be careful with) your heart<br>
