        Who would believe that I could be happy and contented?<br />
        I used to think that happiness hadn't been invented<br />

        I was afraid that maybe you thought you were above me<br />
        That I was only fooling myself to think you'd love me<br />
        But then tonight you said you couldn't live without me<br />
        That round about me you wanted to stay<br />
