    <h2>Oasis - Don't Look Back In Anger</h2>
    <div class="lyric">
        <p><h4>Intro</h4><br /></p>
        <p>
            Slip inside the eye of your mind<br>
            Don't you know you might find<br>
            A better place to play<br><br/>
            You said that you'd never been<br>
            But all the things that you've seen<br>
            Slowly fade away<br>
        </p><br/>
        <p>
            <h4>Bridge</h4>
            So I start a revolution from my bed<br>
            'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head<br>
            Step outside, summertime's in bloom<br>
            Stand up beside the fireplace<br>
            Take that look from off your face<br>
            You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out<br>
        </p><br/>
        <p>
            <h4>Reff</h4>
            And so Sally can wait<br>
            She knows it's too late<br>
            As we're walking on by<br>
            Her soul slides away<br>
            But don't look back in anger<br>
            I heard you say<br>
        <br /></p>
        <p><h4>Intro</h4><br /></p>
        <p>
            Take me to the place where you go<br>
            Where nobody knows<br>
            If it's night or day<br><br/>
            But please don't put your life in the hands<br>
            Of a rock and roll band<br>
            Who'll throw it all away<br>
        <br /></p>
        <p>
            <h4>Bridge</h4>
            I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed<br>
            'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head<br>
            Step outside 'cause summertime's in bloom<br>
            Stand up beside the fireplace<br>
            Take that look from off your face<br>
            'Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out<br>

        <p><h4>Interlude</h4><br /></p>
        <p>
            <h4>Reff II</h4>
            So Sally can wait<br>
            She knows it's too late<br>
            As we're walking on by<br>
            Her soul slides away<br>
            But don't look back in anger<br>
