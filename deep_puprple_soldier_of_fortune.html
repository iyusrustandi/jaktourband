    <h2>Deep Purple - Soldier Of Fortune</h2>
    <div class="lyric">
      <p><h4>Intro</h4><br /></p>
        <p>
            I have often told you stories about the way<br>
            I lived the life of a drifter<br>
            Waiting for the day         <br>       
        </p><br/>
        <p>
            When I'd take your hand and sing you songs<br>
            Then maybe you would say<br>
            "Come lay with me and love me"<br>
            And I would surely stay    <br>         
        </p><br/>
      <p>
        <b>Reff</b><br/>
        But I feel I'm growing older<br>
        And the songs that I have sung<br>
        Echo in the distance<br>
        Like the sound<br>
        Of a windmill going round<br>
        Guess I'll always be a soldier of fortune<br>
      </p><br/>
      <p><h4>Interlude</h4><br /></p>
      <p>
        Many times I've been a traveller<br>
        I looked for something new<br>
        In days of old when nights were cold<br>
        I wandered without you<br>
      </p><br/>
      <p>
        But those days I thought my eyes had seen you standing near<br>
        Though blindness is confusing<br>
        It shows that you're not here<br>
      </p><br/>
      <p>
        <b>Reff</b><br/>
        Now I feel I'm growing older<br>
        And the songs that I have sung<br>
        Echo in the distance<br>
        Like the sound<br>
        Of a windmill going round<br>
        Guess I'll always be a soldier of fortune<br>
      </p><br/>
      <p>
        I can hear the sound<br>
        Of a windmill going round<br>
        Guess I'll always be a soldier of fortune<br>
      </p><br/>
      <p>
        I guess I'll always be<br>
        A soldier of fortune<br>
