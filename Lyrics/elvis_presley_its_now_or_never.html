  <div class="verse">
    When I first saw you<br />
    With your smile so tender<br />
    My heart was captured<br />
    My soul surrendered<br />
    <br />
    I spend a lifetime<br />
    Waiting for the right time<br />
    Now that you're near<br />
    The time is here, at last<br />

  <div class="verse">
    Just like a willow<br />
    We would cry an ocean<br />
    If we lost true love<br />
    And sweet devotion<br />
    <br />
    Your lips excite me<br />
    Let your arms invite me<br />
    For who knows when<br />
    We'll meet again this way<br />
