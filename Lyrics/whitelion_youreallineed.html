    I know that she's waiting<br />
    For me to say forever<br />
    I know that I sometimes<br />
    Just don't know how to tell her<br />
    <br />
    I want to hold and kiss her<br />
    Give her my love<br />
    Make her believe<br />
    'Cause she doesn't know<br />
    She doesn't know<br />

    I know that I've never<br />
    Told her how much I love her<br />

    I see her face before me<br />
    I look in her eyes<br />
    Wondering why<br />
    She doesn't know<br />
    She doesn't know<br />
    <br />
    She doesn't know...<br />
