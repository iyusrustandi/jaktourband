        <p>
            Man, it's a hot one<br>
            Like seven inches from the midday sun<br>
            Well, I hear you whisper and the words melt everyone<br>
            But you stay so cool<br>
       <br>
            My mu√±equita, my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa<br>
            You're my reason for reason<br>
            The step in my groove<br>
        <br>
            <h4>Bridge</h4>
            And if you said this life ain't good enough<br>
            I would give my world to lift you up<br>
            I could change my life to better suit your mood<br>
            Because you're so smooth<br>
        </p><br/><br>

        <div class="reff">
            <h4>Reff</h4>
            And it's just like the ocean under the moon<br>
            Oh, it's the same as the emotion that I get from you<br>
            You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah<br>
            Give me your heart, make it real, or else forget about it<br>
        </div><br/>

<div class="guide">
          <p><b>Intro</b></p>
        </div>
        <br />

        <p>
            But I'll tell you one thing<br>
            If you would leave it'd be a crying shame<br>
            In every breath and every word<br>
            I hear your name calling me out<br>
      <br>
            Out from the barrio<br>
            You hear my rhythm on your radio<br>
            You feel the turning of the world, so soft and slow<br>
            It's turning you round and round<br>
        </p><br/>

            Or else forget about it<br>
            Or else forget about it<br>
            Oh, let's don't forget about it<br>
            Give me your heart, make it real<br>
            Let's don't forget about it (hey)<br>
            Let's don't forget about it (now, oh, now, oh)<br>
            Let's don't forget about it (now, now, now, oh)<br>
            Let's don't forget about it (hey, now, now, oh)<br>
