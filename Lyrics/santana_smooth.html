    Man, it's a hot one<br />
    Like seven inches from the midday sun<br />
    Well, I hear you whisper and the words melt everyone<br />
    But you stay so cool<br />
    <br />
    My muñequita, my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa<br />
    You're my reason for reason<br />
    The step in my groove<br />
    <br />
    <b>Bridge</b><br />
    And if you said this life ain't good enough<br />
    I would give my world to lift you up<br />
    I could change my life to better suit your mood<br />
    Because you're so smooth<br />

  <div class="reff">
    <b>Reff</b><br />
    And it's just like the ocean under the moon<br />
    Oh, it's the same as the emotion that I get from you<br />
    You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah<br />
    Give me your heart, make it real, or else forget about it<br />

  <div class="verse">
    But I'll tell you one thing<br />
    If you would leave it'd be a crying shame<br />
    In every breath and every word<br />
    I hear your name calling me out<br />
    <br />
    Out from the barrio<br />
    You hear my rhythm on your radio<br />
    You feel the turning of the world, so soft and slow<br />
    It's turning you round and round<br />

    Or else forget about it<br />
    Oh, let's don't forget about it<br />
    Give me your heart, make it real<br />
    Let's don't forget about it (hey)<br />
    Let's don't forget about it (now, oh, now, oh)<br />
    Let's don't forget about it (now, now, now, oh)<br />
