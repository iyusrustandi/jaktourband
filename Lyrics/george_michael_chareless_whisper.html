    I feel so unsure<br />
    As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor<br />
    As the music dies, something in your eyes<br />
    Calls to mind a silver screen<br />
    And all its sad good-byes <br />

    I'm never gonna dance again<br />
    Guilty feet have got no rhythm<br />
    Though it's easy to pretend<br />
    I know you're not a fool<br /><br />
    <br />
    I should've known better than to cheat a friend<br />
    And waste the chance that I'd been given<br />
    So I'm never gonna dance again<br />
    The way I danced with you, oh<br />

    Time can never mend<br />
    The careless whispers of a good friend<br />
    To the heart and mind<br />
    Ignorance is kind<br />
    There's no comfort in the truth<br />
    Pain is all you'll find

    (Never without your love)<br />
    <br />
    Tonight the music seems so loud<br />
    I wish that we could lose this crowd<br />
    Maybe it's better this way<br />
    We'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say<br /><br />
    We could have been so good together<br />
    We could have lived this dance forever<br />
    But now, who's gonna dance with me?<br />
    Please stay<br />
