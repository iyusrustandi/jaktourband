    <p><b>Intro</b></p>

  <div class="verse">
    Where do I begin<br />
    To tell the story of how great a love can be<br />
    The sweet love story that is older than the sea<br />
    The simple truth about the love she brings to me<br />
    Where do I start<br />
    <br />
    With her first hello<br />
    She gave new meaning to this empty world of mine<br />
    There'd never be another love, another time<br />
    She came into my life and made the living fine<br />
    She fills my heart<br />

  <div class="reff">
    <b>Reff</b><br />
    She fills my heart with very special things<br />
    With angels' songs, with wild imaginings<br />
    She fills my soul with so much love<br />
    That anywhere I go I'm never lonely<br />
    With her around, who could be lonely<br />
    I reach for her hand, it's always there<br />
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    How long does it last<br />
    Can love be measured by the hours in a day<br />
    I have no answers now but this much I can say<br />
    I know I'll need her 'til the stars all burn away<br />
    And she'll be there<br />
    <br />
    How long does it last<br />
    Can love be measured by the hours in a day<br />
    I have no answers now but this much I can say<br />
    I know I'll need her 'til the stars all burn away<br />
    And she'll be there<br />
