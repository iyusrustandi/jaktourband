    Now that I've lost everything to you<br />
    You say you want to start something new<br />
    And it's breaking my heart you're leaving<br />
    Baby I'm greaving <br />
    <br />
    <b>(*)</b><br />
    But if you want to leave take good care<br />
    Hope you have a lot of nice things to wear<br />
    But then a lot of nice things turn bad out there<br />

    Oh baby baby it's a wild world<br />
    It's hard to get by just upon a smile<br />
    Oh baby baby it's a wild world<br />
    I'll always remember you like a child girl<br />

  <div class="verse">
    You know I've seen a lot of what the world can do<br />
    And it's breaking my heart in two<br />

    Don't be a bad girl<br />
