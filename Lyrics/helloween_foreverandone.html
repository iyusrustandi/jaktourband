    What can I do?<br />
    Will I be getting through?<br />
    Now that I must try<br />
    to leave it all behind <br />
    <br />
    Did you see<br />
    What you have done to me<br />
    So hard to justify<br />
    Slowly is passing by <br />

    Forever and one<br />
    I will miss you<br />
    However, I kiss you<br />
    yet again<br />
    Way down in Neverland<br />
    <br />
    So hard I was trying<br />
    Tomorrow I'll sill be crying<br />
    How could you hide<br />
    your lies, your lies <br />

  <div class="verse">
    Here I am<br />
    Seeing you once again<br />
    My mind's so far away<br />
    My heart's so close<br />
    to stay<br />
    <br />
    Too proud to fight<br />
    I'm walking back into night<br />
    Will I ever find<br />
    Someone to believe?<br />
