    So close, no matter how far<br />
    Couldn't be much more from the heart<br />
    Forever trusting who we are<br />
    And nothing else matters <br />
    <br />
    Never opened myself this way<br />
    Life is ours, we live it our way<br />
    All these words, I don't just say<br />
    And nothing else matters <br />
    <br />
    Trust I seek and I find in you<br />
    Every day for us something new<br />
    Open mind for a different view<br />
    And nothing else matters <br />
