  <div class="verse">
    Another summer day<br />
    Has come and gone away<br />
    In Paris and Rome<br />
    But I wanna go home, mmm<br />
    <br />
    May be surrounded by<br />
    A million people I<br />
    Still feel all alone<br />
    Just wanna go home<br />
    Oh, I miss you, you know<br />
  </div>

  <div class="reff">
    <b>Reff</b><br />
    And I've been keeping all the letters<br />
    That I wrote to you<br />
    Each one a line or two<br />
    I'm fine baby, how are you?<br />
    <br />
    Well I would send them but I know<br />
    That it's just not enough<br />
    My words were cold and flat<br />
    And you deserve more than that<br />

  <div class="verse">
    Another airplane<br />
    Another sunny place<br />
    I'm lucky I know<br />
    But I wanna go home<br />
    Mmm, I got to go home<br />
    <br />
    Let me go home<br />
    I'm just too far<br />
    From where you are<br />
    I wanna come home<br />

  <div class="reff">
    <b>Reff</b><br />
    And I feel just like<br />
    I'm living someone else's life<br />
    It's like I just stepped outside<br />
    When everything was going right<br />
    <br />
    And I know just why you could not<br />
    Come along with me<br />
    That this was not your dream<br />
    But you always believed in me<br />

  <div class="verse">
    Another winter day<br />
    Has come and gone away<br />
    In even Paris and Rome<br />
    And I wanna go home<br />
    Let me go home<br />
    <br />
    And I'm surrounded by<br />
    A million people I<br />
    I still feel alone<br />
    Oh, let me go home<br />
    Oh, I miss you, you know<br />
    <br />
    Let me go home<br />
    I've had my run<br />
    Baby, I'm done<br />
    I gotta go home<br />
    <br />
    Let me go home<br />
    It'll all be all right<br />
    I'll be home tonight<br />
    I'm coming back home<br />
