    25 years and my life is still<br />
    Tryin' to get up that great big hill of hope<br />
    For a destination <br />
    <br />
    I realized quickly when I knew I should<br />
    That the world was made up <br />
    of this brotherhood of man<br />
    For whatever that means<br />
    <br />
    And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed<br />
    Just to get it all out what's in my head<br />
    And I, I am feeling a little peculiar<br />
    <br />
    And so I wake in the morning and I step outside<br />
    And I take a deep breath and I get real high<br />
    And I scream from the top of my lungs<br />
    "What's going on?" <br />

    And I say, hey-ey-ey<br />
    Hey-ey-ey<br />
    I said "Hey, a-what's going on?"<br />
    And I say, hey-ey-ey<br />
    Hey-ey-ey<br />
    I said "Hey, a-what's going on?" <br />

    And I try<br />
    Oh my God, do I try<br />
    I try all the time<br />
    In this institution <br />
    <br />
    And I pray<br />
    Oh my God, do I pray<br />
    I pray every single day<br />
    For revolution<br />
    <br />
    And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed<br />
