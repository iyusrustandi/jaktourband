          Don't hang your head in sorrow<br />
          And please don't cry <br />
          <br />
          I know how you feel inside I've<br />
          I've been there before<br />
          Somethin's changin' inside you<br />
          And don't you know <br />

          And give me a sigh<br />
          Give me a kiss before you<br />
          Tell me goodbye<br />
          <br />
          Don't you take it so hard now<br />
          And please don't take it so bad<br />
          I'll still be thinkin' of you<br />
          And the times we had, baby<br />
