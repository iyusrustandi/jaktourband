    Talk to me softly<br />
    There's something in your eyes<br />
    Don't hang your head in sorrow<br />
    And please don't cry <br />
    <br />
    I know how you feel inside I've<br />
    I've been there before<br />
    Somethin's changin' inside you<br />
    And don't you know <br />

    Give me a whisper<br />
    And give me a sigh<br />
    Give me a kiss before you<br />
    Tell me goodbye<br />
    <br />
    Don't you take it so hard now<br />
    And please don't take it so bad<br />
    I'll still be thinkin' of you<br />
    And the times we had, baby<br />

    And please remember<br />
    That I never lied<br />
    Oh and please remember<br />
    How I felt inside now, honey<br />

    You gotta make it your own way<br />
    But you'll be alright now, sugar<br />
    You'll feel better tomorrow<br />
    Come the morning light now, baby<br />

    Don't you ever cry, cry, cry<br />
    Don't you cry tonight<br />
