    If you love me like you tell me, <br />
    please be careful with my heart<br />
    You can take it, just don't break it <br />
    or my world will fall apart<br />

    You are my first romance and I'm willing to take a chance<br />
    That 'til life is through, I'll still be loving you<br />
    I will be true to you, just a promise from you will do<br />
    From the very start please be careful with my heart<br />

  <div class="verse">
    I love you and you know, I do there'll be no one else for me<br />
    Promise I'll be always true for the world and all to see<br />
    Love has heard some lies softly spoken<br />
    And I have had my heart badly broken<br />
    I've been burned and I've been hurt before<br />
    <br />
    So I know just how you feel, trust my love is real for you<br />
    I'll be gentle with your heart, I'll caress it like the morning dew<br />
    I'll be right beside you forever, I won't let your world fall apart<br />
    From the very start, I'll be careful with your heart<br />
