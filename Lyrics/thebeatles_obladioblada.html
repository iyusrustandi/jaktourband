    Desmond takes a trolley to the jeweler's stores<br />

    In a couple of years they have built<br />
    A home sweet home<br />
    With a couple of kids running in the yard<br />
    Of Desmond and Molly Jones<br />
    (Ah ha ha ha ha ha) <br />
    <br />
    Happy ever after in the market place<br />
    Desmond lets the children lend a hand (Arm! Leg!)<br />
    Molly stays at home and does her pretty face<br />
    And in the evening she still sings it with the band <br />
