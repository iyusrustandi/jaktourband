    Oh! Carol, I am but a fool,<br />
    Darling I love you tho' you treat me cruel,<br />
    You hurt me and you made me cry<br />
    But if you leave me I will surely die.<br />
    <br />
    Darling there will never be another<br />
    Cause I love you so,<br />
    don't ever leave me,<br />
    Say you'll never go<br />
    <br />
    I will always want you for my sweetheart<br />
    No matter what you do<br />
    Oh! Carol, I'm so in love with you.<br />
