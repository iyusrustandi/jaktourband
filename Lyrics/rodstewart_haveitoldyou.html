            <h4>(*)</h4>
            Have I told you lately that I love you<br>
            Have I told you there's no one else above you<br>
            You fill my heart with gladness<br>
            Take away all my sadness<br>
            Ease my troubles, that's what you do<br>
       <br>
            <h4>(**)</h4>
            For the morning sun and all it's glory<br>
            Greets the day with hope and comfort, too<br>
            You fill my life with laughter<br>
            And somehow, you make it better<br>
            Ease my troubles, that's what you do<br>
        </p><br/><br>

        <div class="reff">
            <h4>Reff</h4>
            There's a love that's divine<br>
            And it's yours and it's mine<br>
            Like the sun<br>
            And at the end of the day<br>
            We should give thanks and pray<br>
            To the one, to the one<br>
        </div><br/>

          Have I told you there's no one else above you<br>
