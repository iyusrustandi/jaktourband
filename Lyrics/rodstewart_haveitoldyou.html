  <div class="verse">
    Have I told you lately that I love you<br />
    Have I told you there's no one else above you<br />
    You fill my heart with gladness<br />
    Take away all my sadness<br />
    Ease my troubles, that's what you do<br />
    <br />
    For the morning sun and all it's glory<br />
    Greets the day with hope and comfort, too<br />
    You fill my life with laughter<br />
    And somehow, you make it better<br />
    Ease my troubles, that's what you do<br />

    <b>Reff</b><br />
    There's a love that's divine<br />
    And it's yours and it's mine<br />
    Like the sun<br />
    And at the end of the day<br />
    We should give thanks and pray<br />
    To the one, to the one<br />
