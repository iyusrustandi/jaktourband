    We passed upon the stair<br />
    We spoke of was and when<br />
    Although I wasn't there<br />
    He said I was his friend<br />
    <br />
    Which came as a surprise<br />
    I spoke into his eyes<br />
    I thought you died alone<br />
    A long long time ago <br />

    I laughed and shook hand<br />
    And made my way back home<br />
    I searched for form and land<br />
    For years and years I roamed<br />
    <br />
    I gazed a gazeless stare<br />
    We walked a million hills<br />
    I must have died alone<br />
    A long, long time ago<br />
