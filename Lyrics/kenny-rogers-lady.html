    Lady, I'm your knight <br />
    in shining armour and I love you<br />
    You have made me <br />
    what I am and I am yours<br />
    <br />
    My love, there's so many ways <br />
    I want to say I love you<br />
    Let me hold you in my arms <br />
    for...ever more<br />

    And all we belong together<br />
    Won't you believe in my song<br />

    in my ear<br />
