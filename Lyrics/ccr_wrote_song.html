        <br />

        <p>
          Met myself a-coming, county welfare line<br />
          I was feeling strung out, hung out on the line<br />
          Saw myself a-going down to war in June<br />
          All I want, all I want is to write myself a tune<br />
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />

        <div class="reff">
          <b>Reff</b><br />
          Wrote a song for everyone<br />
          Wrote a song for truth<br />
          Wrote a song for everyone<br />
          When I couldn't even talk to you<br />
        </div>
        <br /><br />

        <div class="guide">
          <p><b>Intro</b></p>
        </div>
        <br />

        <p>
          Got myself arrested, wound me up in jail<br />
          Richmond about to blow up, communication failed<br />
          If you see the answer, now's the time to say<br />
          All I want, all I want is to get you down to pray<br />
        </p>
        <br />

          <p>Back To : <b>Reff</b></p>
        </div>
        <br />

        <p>
          Saw the people standing, thousand years in chains<br />
          Somebody said it's different now, look it's just the same<br />
          Pharaohs spin the message, round and round the truth<br />
          They could have saved a million people, how can I tell you?<br />
