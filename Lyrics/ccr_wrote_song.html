  <div class="verse">
    Met myself a-coming, county welfare line<br />
    I was feeling strung out, hung out on the line<br />
    Saw myself a-going down to war in June<br />
    All I want, all I want is to write myself a tune<br />

    <b>Reff</b><br />
    Wrote a song for everyone<br />
    Wrote a song for truth<br />
    Wrote a song for everyone<br />
    When I couldn't even talk to you<br />

  <div class="verse">
    Got myself arrested, wound me up in jail<br />
    Richmond about to blow up, communication failed<br />
    If you see the answer, now's the time to say<br />
    All I want, all I want is to get you down to pray<br />

  <div class="verse">
    Saw the people standing, thousand years in chains<br />
    Somebody said it's different now, look it's just the same<br />
    Pharaohs spin the message, round and round the truth<br />
    They could have saved a million people, how can I tell you?<br />
