  <div class="verse">
    I have often told you stories about the way<br />
    I lived the life of a drifter<br />
    Waiting for the day <br />
    <br />
    When I'd take your hand and sing you songs<br />
    Then maybe you would say<br />
    "Come lay with me and love me"<br />
    And I would surely stay <br />

    <b>Reff</b><br />
    But I feel I'm growing older<br />
    And the songs that I have sung<br />
    Echo in the distance<br />
    Like the sound<br />
    Of a windmill going round<br />
    Guess I'll always be a soldier of fortune<br />

  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    Many times I've been a traveller<br />
    I looked for something new<br />
    In days of old when nights were cold<br />
    I wandered without you<br />
    <br />
    But those days I thought my eyes had seen you standing near<br />
    Though blindness is confusing<br />
    It shows that you're not here<br />

    Now I feel I'm growing older<br />
    And the songs that I have sung<br />
    Echo in the distance<br />
    Like the sound<br />
    Of a windmill going round<br />
    Guess I'll always be a soldier of fortune<br />
    <br />
    I can hear the sound<br />
    Of a windmill going round<br />
    Guess I'll always be a soldier of fortune<br />
    <br />
    I guess I'll always be<br />
    A soldier of fortune<br />
