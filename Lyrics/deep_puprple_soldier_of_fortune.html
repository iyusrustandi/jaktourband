        <p>
          I have often told you stories about the way<br />
          I lived the life of a drifter<br />
          Waiting for the day <br />
          <br />
          When I'd take your hand and sing you songs<br />
          Then maybe you would say<br />
          "Come lay with me and love me"<br />
          And I would surely stay <br />
        </p>
        <br /><br />

        <div class="reff">
          <b>Reff</b><br />
          But I feel I'm growing older<br />
          And the songs that I have sung<br />
          Echo in the distance<br />
          Like the sound<br />
          Of a windmill going round<br />
          Guess I'll always be a soldier of fortune<br />

        <br /><br />

        <p>
          Many times I've been a traveller<br />
          I looked for something new<br />
          In days of old when nights were cold<br />
          I wandered without you<br />
          <br />
          But those days I thought my eyes had seen you standing near<br />
          Though blindness is confusing<br />
          It shows that you're not here<br />
        </p>
        <br /><br />

        <div class="reff">
          <b>Reff</b><br />
          Now I feel I'm growing older<br />
          And the songs that I have sung<br />
          Echo in the distance<br />
          Like the sound<br />
          Of a windmill going round<br />
          Guess I'll always be a soldier of fortune<br />
          <br />
          I can hear the sound<br />
          Of a windmill going round<br />
          Guess I'll always be a soldier of fortune<br />
          <br />
          I guess I'll always be<br />
          A soldier of fortune<br />
