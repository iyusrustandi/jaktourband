  <div class="verse">
    I don't know why<br />
    You said goodbye<br />
    Just let me know you didn't go<br />
    Forever my love<br />
    <br />
    Please tell me why<br />
    You make me cry<br />
    I beg you please I'm on my knees<br />
    If that's what you want me to<br />

    <b>Reff</b><br />
    Never knew that it would go so far<br />
    When you left me on that boulevard<br />
    Come again, you would release my pain<br />
    And we could be lovers again<br />
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    Just one more chance<br />
    Another dance<br />
    And let me feel it isn't real<br />
    That I've been losing you<br />
    <br />
    This sun will rise<br />
    Within your eyes<br />
    Come back to me and we will be<br />
    Happy together<br />

  <div class="verse">
    Maybe today<br />
    I'll make you stay<br />
    A little while just for a smile<br />
    And love together<br />
    For I will show<br />
    A place I know<br />
    In Tokyo where we could be<br />
    Happy forever<br />
