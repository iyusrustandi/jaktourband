    Baby, lock the door and turn the lights down low<br />
    And put some music on that's soft and slow<br />
    Baby, we ain't got no place to go<br />
    I hope you understand<br />

    I've been thinking 'bout this all day long<br />
    Never felt a feeling quite this strong<br />
    I can't believe how much it turns me on<br />
    Just to be your man<br />
    <br />
    There's no hurry, don't you worry<br />
    We can take our time<br />
    Come a little closer, let's go over<br />
    What I had in mind<br />

    Ain't nobody ever love nobody<br />
    The way that I love you<br />
    We're alone now<br />
