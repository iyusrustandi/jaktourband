    Baby, lock the door and turn the lights down low<br />
    And put some music on that's soft and slow<br />
    Baby, we ain't got no place to go<br />
    I hope you understand<br />
    <br />
    I've been thinking 'bout this all day long<br />
    Never felt a feeling quite this strong<br />
    I can't believe how much it turns me on<br />
    Just to be your man<br />

    We can take our time<br />

    What I had in mind<br />
