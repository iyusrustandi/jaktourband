        <p>
          The Milky Way upon the heavens<br />
          Is twinkling just for you<br />
          And Mr. Moon he came by<br />
          To say goodnight to you <br />
          <br />
          I'll sing for you I'll sing for mother<br />
          We're praying for the world<br />
          And for the people everywhere<br />
          Gonna show them all we care<br />
        </p>
        <br /><br />

        <div class="reff">
          <h4>Reff</h4>
          Oh my sleeping child, the world's so wild<br />
          But you've built your own paradise<br />
          That's one reason why I'll cover you sleeping child<br />
        </div>
        <br />

        <p>
          If all the people around the world<br />
          They had a mind like yours<br />
          We'd have no fighting and no wars<br />
          There would be lasting peace on Earth<br />
          <br />
          If all the kings and all the leaders<br />
          Could see you here this way<br />
          They would hold the Earth in their arms<br />
          They would learn to watch you play<br />
          <br />

          I'm gonna cover my sleeping child<br />
          Keep you away from the world so wild<br />
          Keep you away from the...<br />
          World so wild...<br />
