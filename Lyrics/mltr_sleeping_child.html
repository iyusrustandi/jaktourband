  <div class="verse">
    The Milky Way upon the heavens<br />
    Is twinkling just for you<br />
    And Mr. Moon he came by<br />
    To say goodnight to you <br />
    <br />
    I'll sing for you I'll sing for mother<br />
    We're praying for the world<br />
    And for the people everywhere<br />
    Gonna show them all we care<br />

    <b>Reff</b><br />
    Oh my sleeping child, the world's so wild<br />
    But you've built your own paradise<br />
    That's one reason why I'll cover you sleeping child<br />
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    If all the people around the world<br />
    They had a mind like yours<br />
    We'd have no fighting and no wars<br />
    There would be lasting peace on Earth<br />
    <br />
    If all the kings and all the leaders<br />
    Could see you here this way<br />
    They would hold the Earth in their arms<br />
    They would learn to watch you play<br />
