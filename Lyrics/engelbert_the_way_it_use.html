    <p><b>Intro</b></p>
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    Lonely table just for one<br />
    In a bright and crowded room<br />
    While the music has begun<br />
    I drink to memories in the gloom<br />
    <br />
    Though the music's still the same<br />
    It has a bittersweet refrain<br />
  </div>

  <div class="reff">
    <b>Reff</b><br />
    So play the song the way it used to be<br />
    Before she left and changed it all to sadness<br />
    And maybe if she's passing by the window<br />
    She will hear a love song<br />
    And a melody<br />
    And even if the words are not so tender<br />
    She will always remember<br />
    The way it used to be <br />
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    Friends stop by and say hello<br />
    And I laugh and hide the pain<br />
    <br />
    It's quite easy to let go<br />
    Then the song begins again <br />
