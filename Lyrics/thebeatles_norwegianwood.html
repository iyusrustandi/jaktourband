          <p><b>Intro</b></p>
        </div>
        <br />

        <p>
          I once had a girl<br />
          Or should I say she once had me<br />
          She showed me her room<br />
          Isn't it good Norwegian wood?<br />
        </p>
        <br /><br />

        <div class="reff">
          <h4>Reff I</h4>
          She asked me to stay<br />
          And she told me to sit anywhere<br />
          So I looked around<br />
          And I noticed there wasn't a chair<br />
        </div>
        <br />

        <p>
          I sat on a rug biding my time<br />
          Drinking her wine<br />
          We talked until two and then she said<br />
          "It's time for bed"<br />
        </p>
        <br />

        <div class="guide">
          <p><b>Interlude</b></p>
        </div>
        <br />

        <div class="reff">
          <h4>Reff II</h4>
          She told me she worked<br />
          In the morning and started to laugh<br />
          I told her I didn't<br />
          And crawled off to sleep in the bath <br />
        </div>
        <br />

        <p>
          And when I awoke I was alone<br />
          This bird had flown<br />
          So I lit a fire<br />
          Isn't it good Norwegian wood?<br />
        </p>
        <br />

        <div class="guide">
          <p><b>Coda</b></p>
