    I once had a girl<br />
    Or should I say she once had me<br />
    She showed me her room<br />
    Isn't it good Norwegian wood?<br />

  <div class="reff">
    <b>Reff I</b><br />
    She asked me to stay<br />
    And she told me to sit anywhere<br />
    So I looked around<br />
    And I noticed there wasn't a chair<br />
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    I sat on a rug biding my time<br />
    Drinking her wine<br />
    We talked until two and then she said<br />
    "It's time for bed"<br />
  </div>

    <b>Reff II</b><br />
    She told me she worked<br />
    In the morning and started to laugh<br />
    I told her I didn't<br />
    And crawled off to sleep in the bath <br />
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    And when I awoke I was alone<br />
    This bird had flown<br />
    So I lit a fire<br />
    Isn't it good Norwegian wood?<br />
