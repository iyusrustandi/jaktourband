    <h2>The Beatles - Norwegian Wood</h2>
    <div class="lyric">
        <p><h4>Intro</h4></p><br />
        <p>
            I once had a girl<br>
            Or should I say she once had me<br>
            She showed me her room<br>
            Isn't it good Norwegian wood?<br>
        </p><br/>
        <p>
            <h4>Reff I</h4>
            She asked me to stay<br>
            And she told me to sit anywhere<br>
            So I looked around<br>
            And I noticed there wasn't a chair<br>
        </p><br/><br/>
        <p>
            I sat on a rug biding my time<br>
            Drinking her wine<br>
            We talked until two and then she said<br>
            "It's time for bed"<br>
        </p><br/>
        <p><h4>Interlude</h4></p><br />
        <p>
            <h4>Reff II</h4>
            She told me she worked<br>
            In the morning and started to laugh<br>
            I told her I didn't<br>
            And crawled off to sleep in the bath  <br>    
        </p><br/><br>
        <p>
            And when I awoke I was alone<br>
            This bird had flown<br>
            So I lit a fire<br>
            Isn't it good Norwegian wood?<br>            
        </p><br/>
