    If you're leaving close the door.<br />
    I'm not expecting people anymore.<br />
    Hear me grieving, I'm lying on the floor.<br />
    Whether I'm drunk or dead I really ain't too sure. <br />

    I'm a blind man, <br />
    I'm a blind man and my world is pale.<br />
    When a blind man cries, <br />
    Lord, you know there ain't no sadder tale.<br />

  <div class="verse">
    Had a friend once in a room,<br />
    Had a good time but it ended much too soon.<br />
    In a cold month in that room<br />
    We found a reason for the things we had to do.<br />

    I'm a blind man, <br />
    I'm a blind man, now my room is cold.<br />
    When a blind man cries, <br />
    Lord, you know he feels it from his soul.<br />
