  <div class="verse">
    Smile an everlasting smile<br />
    A smile can bring you near to me<br />
    Don't ever let me find you down<br />
    'Cause that would bring a tear to me<br />
    <br />
    This world has lost its glory<br />
    Let's start a brand new story now, my love<br />
    Right now, there'll be no other time<br />
    And I can show you how, my love<br />
    <br />
    Talk in everlasting words<br />
    And dedicate them all to me<br />
    And I will give you all my life<br />
    I'm here if you should call to me <br />

    You think that I don't even mean<br />
    A single word I say<br />
    It's only words and words are all I have<br />
    To take your heart away<br />
