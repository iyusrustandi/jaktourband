          We're leavin' together<br />
          But still it's farewell<br />
          And maybe we'll come back<br />
          To Earth, who can tell?<br />
          I guess there is no one to blame<br />
          We're leaving ground (leaving ground)<br />
          Will things ever be the same again?<br />

          And still we stand tall<br />
          'Cause maybe they've seen us<br />
          And welcome us all, yeah<br />
          With so many light years to go<br />
          And things to be found (to be found)<br />
          I'm sure that we all miss her so<br />
