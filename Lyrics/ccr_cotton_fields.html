    When I was a little bitty baby<br />
    My mama would rock me in the cradle<br />
    In them old cotton fields back home<br />
    <br />
    It was down in Louisiana<br />
    Just about a mile from Texarkana<br />
    In them old cotton fields back home<br />

    Oh, when them cotton bolls get rotten<br />
    You can't pick very much cotton<br />
