    Left a good job in the city,<br />
    Workin' for the man ev'ry night and day,<br />
    And I never lost one minute of sleepin',<br />
    Worryin' 'bout the way things might have been. <br />

  <div class="verse">
    Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis,<br />
    Pumped a lot of pain down in New Orleans,<br />
    But I never saw the good side of the city,<br />
    'Til I hitched a ride on a river boat queen.<br />

    If you come down to the river,<br />
    Bet you gonna find some people who live.<br />
    You don't have to worry 'cause you have no money,<br />
    People on the river are happy to give.<br />
