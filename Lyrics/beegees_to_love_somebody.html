    There's a light<br />
    A certain kind of light<br />
    That never shone on me<br />
    I want my life to be lived with you<br />
    Lived with you <br />
    <br />
    There's a way everybody say<br />
    To do each and every little thing<br />
    But what does it bring<br />
    If I ain't got you, ain't got?<br />

    In my brain<br />
    I see your face again<br />
    I know my frame of mind<br />
    You ain't got to be so blind<br />
    And I'm blind, so, so, so blind<br />
    <br />
    I'm a man<br />
    Can't you see what I am?<br />
    I live and I breathe for you<br />
    But what good does it do<br />
    If I ain't got you, ain't got?<br />
