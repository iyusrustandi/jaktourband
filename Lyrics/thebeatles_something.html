  <div class="verse">
    Something in the way she moves<br />
    Attracts me like no other lover<br />
    Something in the way she woos me<br />
    <br />
    I don't want to leave her now<br />
    You know I believe and how<br />
    <br />
    Somewhere in her smile she knows<br />
    That I don't need no other lover<br />
    Something in her style that shows me<br />
    <br />
    I don't want to leave her now<br />
    You know I believe and how<br />
    <br />
    You're asking me will my love grow<br />
    I don't know, I don't know<br />
    <br />
    You stick around, now it may show<br />
    I don't know, I don't know<br />

    Something in the way she knows<br />
    And all I have to do is think of her<br />
    Something in the things she shows me<br />
    <br />
    I don't want to leave her now<br />
    You know I believe and how<br />
