        <p><h4>Intro</h4></p><br />
        <p>
            Something in the way she moves<br>
            Attracts me like no other lover<br>
            Something in the way she woos me<br>
            I don't want to leave her now<br>
            You know I believe and how<br>
        </p><br/>
        <p>
            Somewhere in her smile she knows<br>
            That I don't need no other lover<br>
            Something in her style that shows me<br>
            I don't want to leave her now<br>
            You know I believe and how<br>
        </p><br/>
        <p>
            You're asking me will my love grow<br>
            I don't know, I don't know<br>
            You stick around, now it may show<br>
            I don't know, I don't know<br>
        </p><br/>
        <p><b>Interlude</b></p><br/>
        <p>
            Something in the way she knows<br>
            And all I have to do is think of her<br>
            Something in the things she shows me<br>
            I don't want to leave her now<br>
            You know I believe and how<br>
        </p><br />
