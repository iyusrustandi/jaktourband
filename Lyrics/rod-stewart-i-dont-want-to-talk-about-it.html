    I can tell by your eyes<br />
    That you've probably <br />
    been cryin' forever<br />
    <br />
    And the stars in the sky<br />
    Don't mean nothin' <br />
    to you they're a mirror<br />

    I don't wanna talk about it<br />
    How you broke my heart<br />

    If I stay here won't you listen <br />
    to my heart?<br />
    whoa, my heart<br />

    If I stand all alone<br />
    Will the shadow <br />
    hide the color of my heart?<br />
    Blue for the tears, <br />
    black for the night's<br />
    <br />
    Fears the stars in the sky<br />
    Don't mean nothin' <br />
    to you they're a mirror<br />
