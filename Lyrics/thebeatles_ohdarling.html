    Oh darling, please believe me<br />
    I'll never do you no harm<br />
    Believe me when I tell you<br />
    I'll never do you no harm <br />
    <br />
    Oh darling, if you leave me<br />
    I'll never make it alone<br />
    Believe me when I beg you<br />
    Don't ever leave me alone<br />
    <br />
    When you told me you didn't need me anymore<br />
    Well, you know I nearly broke down and cried<br />
    When you told me you didn't need me anymore<br />
    Well, you know I nearly broke down and died<br />
    <br />
    Oh darling, if you leave me<br />
    I'll never make it alone<br />
    Believe me when I tell you<br />
    I'll never do you no harm<br />
    Believe me, darlin'<br />
    <br />
    When you told me, woo, you didn't need me anymore<br />
    Well, you know I nearly broke down and cried<br />
    When you told me you didn't need me anymore<br />
    Well, you know I nearly fell down and died <br />
    <br />
    Oh darling, please believe me<br />
    I'll never let you down<br />
    Oh, believe me, darlin'<br />
    Believe me when I tell you<br />
    I'll never do you no harm<br />
