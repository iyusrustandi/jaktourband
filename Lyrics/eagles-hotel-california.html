        </div>
        <br /><br />

        <p>
          On a dark desert highway<br />
          Cool wind in my hair<br />
          Warm smell of colitas<br />
          Rising up through the air<br />
          Up ahead in the distance<br />
          I saw a shimmering light<br />
          My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim<br />
          I had to stop for the night <br />
          <br />
          There she stood in the doorway<br />
          I heard the mission bell<br />
          And I was thinking to myself<br />
          "This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"<br />
          Then she lit up a candle<br />
          And she showed me the way<br />
          There were voices down the corridor<br />
          I thought I heard them say<br />
        </p>
        <br /><br />

        <div class="reff">
          <b>Reff</b><br />
          Welcome to the Hotel California<br />
          Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)<br />
          Such a lovely face<br />
          Plenty of room at the Hotel California<br />
          Any time of year (any time of year)<br />
          You can find it here <br />
        </div>
        <br /><br />

        <p>
          Her mind is Tiffany-twisted<br />
          She got the Mercedes Benz<br />
          She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys<br />
          That she calls friends<br />
          How they dance in the courtyard<br />
          Sweet summer sweat<br />
          Some dance to remember<br />
          Some dance to forget <br />
          <br />
          So I called up the Captain<br />
          "Please bring me my wine"<br />
          He said, 'We haven't had that spirit here<br />
          Since 1969"<br />
          And still those voices are calling from far away<br />
          Wake you up in the middle of the night<br />
          Just to hear them say <br />
        </p>
        <br /><br />

        <div class="reff">
          <b>Reff</b><br />
          Welcome to the Hotel California<br />
          Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)<br />
          Such a lovely face<br />
          They livin' it up at the Hotel California<br />
          What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)<br />
          Bring your alibis <br />
        </div>
        <br /><br />

        <p>
          Mirrors on the ceiling<br />
          The pink champagne on ice<br />
          And she said, 'We are all just prisoners here<br />
          Of our own device"<br />
          And in the master's chambers<br />
          They gathered for the feast<br />
          They stab it with their steely knives<br />
          But they just can't kill the beast <br />
          <br />
          Last thing I remember, I was<br />
          Running for the door<br />
          I had to find the passage back<br />
          To the place I was before<br />
          "Relax, " said the night man<br />
          "We are programmed to receive<br />
          You can check out any time you like<br />
          But you can never leave" <br />
        </p>
