  <div class="verse">
    On a dark desert highway<br />
    Cool wind in my hair<br />
    Warm smell of colitas<br />
    Rising up through the air<br />
    Up ahead in the distance<br />
    I saw a shimmering light<br />
    My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim<br />
    I had to stop for the night <br />
    <br />
    There she stood in the doorway<br />
    I heard the mission bell<br />
    And I was thinking to myself<br />
    "This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"<br />
    Then she lit up a candle<br />
    And she showed me the way<br />
    There were voices down the corridor<br />
    I thought I heard them say<br />

    Welcome to the Hotel California<br />
    Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)<br />
    Such a lovely face<br />
    Plenty of room at the Hotel California<br />
    Any time of year (any time of year)<br />
    You can find it here <br />

  <div class="verse">
    Her mind is Tiffany-twisted<br />
    She got the Mercedes Benz<br />
    She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys<br />
    That she calls friends<br />
    How they dance in the courtyard<br />
    Sweet summer sweat<br />
    Some dance to remember<br />
    Some dance to forget <br />
    <br />
    So I called up the Captain<br />
    "Please bring me my wine"<br />
    He said, 'We haven't had that spirit here<br />
    Since 1969"<br />
    And still those voices are calling from far away<br />
    Wake you up in the middle of the night<br />
    Just to hear them say <br />

    Mirrors on the ceiling<br />
    The pink champagne on ice<br />
    And she said, 'We are all just prisoners here<br />
    Of our own device"<br />
    And in the master's chambers<br />
    They gathered for the feast<br />
    They stab it with their steely knives<br />
    But they just can't kill the beast <br />
    <br />
    Last thing I remember, I was<br />
    Running for the door<br />
    I had to find the passage back<br />
    To the place I was before<br />
    "Relax, " said the night man<br />
    "We are programmed to receive<br />
    You can check out any time you like<br />
    But you can never leave" <br />
