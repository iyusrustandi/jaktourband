    Slip inside the eye of your mind<br />
    Don't you know you might find<br />
    A better place to play<br /><br />
    You said that you'd never been<br />
    But all the things that you've seen<br />
    Slowly fade away<br />
    <br />
    <b>Bridge</b><br />
    So I start a revolution from my bed<br />
    'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head<br />
    Step outside, summertime's in bloom<br />
    Stand up beside the fireplace<br />
    Take that look from off your face<br />
    You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out<br />

    And so Sally can wait<br />
    She knows it's too late<br />

    Her soul slides away<br />
    But don't look back in anger<br />
    I heard you say<br />

    Take me to the place where you go<br />
    Where nobody knows<br />
    If it's night or day<br /><br />
    But please don't put your life in the hands<br />
    Of a rock and roll band<br />
    Who'll throw it all away<br />
