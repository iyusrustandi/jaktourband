    <p><b>Intro</b></p>
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    Sitting here wasted and wounded<br />
    At this old piano<br />
    Trying hard to capture<br />
    The moment this morning I don't know <br />
    <br />
    'Cause a bottle of Vodka's <br />
    still lodged in my head<br />
    And some blonde gave me nightmares<br />
    Think that she's still in my bed<br />
    As I dream about movies<br />
    They won't make of me when I'm dead <br />
    <br />
    With an ironclad fist<br />
    I wake up and french kiss the morning<br />
    While some marching band <br />
    keeps its own beat in my head<br />
    While we're talking <br />
    <br />
    About all of the things that I long to believe<br />
    About love, the truth, what you mean to me<br />
    And the truth is<br />
    Baby you're all that I need <br />

    <b>Reff</b><br />
    I want to lay you down in a bed of roses<br />
    For tonight I'll sleep on a bed of nails<br />
    Oh I want to be<br />
    just as close as the Holy Ghost is<br />
    And lay you down on a bed of roses<br />
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    Well I'm so far away<br />
    Each step that I take is on my way home<br />
    A king's ransom in dimes, I'd give each night<br />
    To see through this payphone <br />
    <br />
    Still I run out of time<br />
    Or it's hard to get through<br />
    Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you<br />
    I'll just close my eyes and whisper<br />
    "Baby, blind love is true" <br />

  <div class="reff">
    <b>Reff</b><br />
    I want to lay you down in a bed of roses<br />

    And lay you down on a bed of roses<br />

  <div class="verse">
    <b>Bridge</b><br />
    Well this hotel bar's hangover whiskey's gone dry<br />
    The barkeeper's wig's crooked<br />
    And she's giving me the eye<br />
    Well I might have said yeah<br />
    But I laughed so hard I think I died<br />
    Ooh yeah<br />

    <p><b>Interlude</b></p>
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    Now as you close your eyes<br />
    Know I'll be thinking about you<br />
    While my mistress she calls me<br />
    To stand in her spotlight again<br />
    <br />
    Tonight I won't be alone<br />
    But you know that don't mean I'm not lonely<br />
    I've got nothing to prove<br />
    For it's you that I'd die to defend<br />

    And lay you down on a bed of roses<br />
