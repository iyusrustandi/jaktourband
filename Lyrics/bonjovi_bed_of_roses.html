        <p>
          Sitting here wasted and wounded<br />
          At this old piano<br />
          Trying hard to capture<br />
          The moment this morning I don't know <br />
          <br />
          'Cause a bottle of Vodka's still lodged in my head<br />
          And some blonde gave me nightmares<br />
          Think that she's still in my bed<br />
          As I dream about movies<br />
          They won't make of me when I'm dead <br />
          <br />
          With an ironclad fist<br />
          I wake up and french kiss the morning<br />
          While some marching band keeps its own beat in my head<br />
          While we're talking <br />
          <br />
          About all of the things that I long to believe<br />
          About love, the truth, what you mean to me<br />
          And the truth is<br />
          Baby you're all that I need <br />
        </p>
        <br /><br />

        <div class="reff">
          <b>Reff</b><br />
          I want to lay you down in a bed of roses<br />
          For tonight I'll sleep on a bed of nails<br />
          Oh I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is<br />
          And lay you down on a bed of roses<br />
        </div>
        <br /><br />

        <p>
          Well I'm so far away<br />
          Each step that I take is on my way home<br />
          A king's ransom in dimes, I'd give each night<br />
          To see through this payphone <br />
          <br />
          Still I run out of time<br />
          Or it's hard to get through<br />
          Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you<br />
          I'll just close my eyes and whisper<br />
          "Baby, blind love is true" <br />
        </p>
        <br /><br />

          <b>Bridge</b><br />
          Well this hotel bar's hangover whiskey's gone dry<br />
          The barkeeper's wig's crooked<br />
          And she's giving me the eye<br />
          Well I might have said yeah<br />
          But I laughed so hard I think I died<br />
          Ooh yeah<br />
        </p>
        <br /><br />

        <div class="guide">

        <br /><br />

        <p>
          Now as you close your eyes<br />
          Know I'll be thinking about you<br />
          While my mistress she calls me<br />
          To stand in her spotlight again<br />
          <br />
          Tonight I won't be alone<br />
          But you know that don't mean I'm not lonely<br />
          I've got nothing to prove<br />
          For it's you that I'd die to defend<br />
        </p>
