    As we talk the golden mile<br />
    Down the pretty aisle<br />
    I know that you are mine<br />
    And there's nothing in this world <br />
    <br />
    That I know that I won't do<br />
    To be near you everyday<br />
    Every hour every minute<br />
    Take my hand and let me lead the way <br />

    <b>Reff</b><br />
    All through your life<br />
    I'll be by your side<br />
    Till death do us part<br />
    Baby, i'll be your friend <br />
    My love will never end<br />
    Till death do us part <br />

  <div class="verse">
    When I wake up everyday<br />
    With you lying in my arms<br />
    I wonder if I'm dreaming<br />
    When I look into your eyes<br />
    <br />
    I just can't believe it's true<br />
    That my heart belongs to you<br />
    Baby you can have it all<br />
    That my heart belongs to you<br />

    There'll be good times<br />
    And there'll be bad<br />
    But I will stand beside you woman<br />
    All the way<br />
    <br />
    And through the years<br />
    As life goes on Ã…?n' on<br />
    When snow will fall on winter nights<br />
    I'll keep you warm inside<br />
    Yeah baby I will<br />
