        <p>
          Well, she was just seventeen<br />
          You know what I mean<br />
          And the way she looked<br />
          Was way beyond compare<br />
          <br />
          So how could I dance with another<br />
          Ooh, when I saw her standing there?<br />
          <br />
          Well, she looked at me<br />
          And I, I could see<br />
          That before too long<br />
          I'd fall in love with her<br />
          <br />
          She wouldn't dance with another<br />
          Ooh, when I saw her standing there<br />
        </p>
        <br /><br />

        <div class="reff">
          <h4>Reff</h4>
          Well, my heart went "boom"<br />
          When I crossed that room<br />
          And I held her hand in mine<br />
        </div>
        <br />

        <p>
          Oh we danced through the night<br />
          And we held each other tight<br />
          And before too long<br />
          I fell in love with her<br />
          <br />
          Now I'll never dance with another<br />
          Ooh, since I saw her standing there <br />
        </p>

          Oh, we danced through the night<br />
          And we held each other tight<br />
          And before too long<br />
          I fell in love with her<br />
          Now I'll never dance with another<br />
          Oh, since I saw her standing there<br />
          Oh, since I saw her standing there<br />
