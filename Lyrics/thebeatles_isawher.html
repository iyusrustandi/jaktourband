    Well, she was just seventeen<br />
    You know what I mean<br />
    And the way she looked<br />
    Was way beyond compare<br />
    <br />
    So how could I dance with another<br />
    Ooh, when I saw her standing there?<br />
    <br />
    Well, she looked at me<br />
    And I, I could see<br />
    That before too long<br />
    I'd fall in love with her<br />
    <br />
    She wouldn't dance with another<br />
    Ooh, when I saw her standing there<br />

    Well, my heart went "boom"<br />
    When I crossed that room<br />
    And I held her hand in mine<br />

  <div class="verse">
    Oh we danced through the night<br />
    And we held each other tight<br />
    And before too long<br />
    I fell in love with her<br />
    <br />
    Now I'll never dance with another<br />
    Ooh, since I saw her standing there <br />
