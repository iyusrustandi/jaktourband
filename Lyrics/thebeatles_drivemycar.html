        <p><h4>Intro</h4></p><br />
        <p>
            Asked a girl what she wanted to be<br>
            She said, "Baby, can't you see?<br>
            I wanna be famous, a star of the screen"<br>
            But you can do something in between <br>
        </p><br/>
        <p>
            <h4>Reff</h4>
            Baby, you can drive my car<br>
            Yes, I'm gonna be a star<br>
            Baby, you can drive my car<br>
            And maybe I'll love you<br>
        </p><br/>
        <p>
            I told that girl that my prospects were good<br>
            And she said, "Baby, it's understood<br>
            Working for peanuts is all very fine<br>
            But I can show you a better time"<br>
        </p><br/>
        <p>Back To : <b>Reff</b></p><br/>
        <p>
            Beep-beep, beep-beep, yeah  <br>                                              
        </p><br/>
        <p><h4>Interlude</h4></p><br />
        <p>Back To : <b>Reff</b></p><br/>
        <p>
            I told that girl I can start right away<br>
            When she said, "Listen, babe, I got somethin' to say<br>
            I got no car and it's breaking my heart<br>
            But I've found a driver and that's a start" <br>                                              
        </p><br/>
        <p>Back To : <b>Reff</b></p><br/>
        <p>
            Beep-beep, beep-beep, yeah<br>
            Beep-beep, beep-beep, yeah<br>
            Beep-beep, beep-beep, yeah<br>
            Beep-beep, beep-beep, yeah  <br>
