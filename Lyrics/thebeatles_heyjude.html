        <p>
          Hey Jude, don't make it bad.<br />
          Take a sad song and make it better.<br />
          Remember to let her into your heart,<br />
          Then you can start to make it better. <br />
          <br />
          Hey Jude, don't be afraid.<br />
          You were made to go out and get her.<br />
          The minute you let her under your skin,<br />
          Then you begin to make it better.<br />

        <div class="reff">
          <h4>Reff</h4>
          And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain,<br />
          Don't carry the world upon your shoulders.<br />
          For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool<br />
          By making his world a little colder.<br />

          You have found her, now go and get her.<br />
          Remember to let her into your heart,<br />

          And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do,<br />
