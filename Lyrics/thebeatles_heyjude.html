    Hey Jude, don't make it bad.<br />
    Take a sad song and make it better.<br />
    Remember to let her into your heart,<br />
    Then you can start to make it better. <br />
    <br />
    Hey Jude, don't be afraid.<br />
    You were made to go out and get her.<br />
    The minute you let her under your skin,<br />
    Then you begin to make it better.<br />

    And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain,<br />
    Don't carry the world upon your shoulders.<br />
    For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool<br />
    By making his world a little colder.<br />
