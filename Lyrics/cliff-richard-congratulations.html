    Who would believe that I could be happy and contented?<br />
    I used to think that happiness hadn't been invented<br />
    But that was in the bad old days before I met you<br />
    When I let you walk into my heart<br />

    I was afraid that maybe you thought you were above me<br />
    That I was only fooling myself to think you'd love me<br />
    But then tonight you said you couldn't live without me<br />
    That round about me you wanted to stay<br />
