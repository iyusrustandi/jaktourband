          <h4>Reff</h4>
          Congratulations<br />
          And celebrations<br />
          When I tell everyone that you're in love with me<br />
          Congratulations<br />
          And jubilations<br />
          I want the world to know I'm happy as can be<br />

        <p>
          Who would believe that I could be happy and contented?<br />
          I used to think that happiness hadn't been invented<br />
          But that was in the bad old days before I met you<br />
          When I let you walk into my heart<br />
        </p>
        <br /><br />

        <div class="guide">
          <p>Back To : <b>Reff</b></p>
        </div>
        <br /><br />

        <p>
          I was afraid that maybe you thought you were above me<br />
          That I was only fooling myself to think you'd love me<br />
          But then tonight you said you couldn't live without me<br />
          That round about me you wanted to stay<br />
        </p>
        <br /><br />
