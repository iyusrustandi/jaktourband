  <div class="verse">
    I've been alone with you inside my mind<br />
    And in my dreams I've kissed your lips a thousand times<br />
    I sometimes see you pass outside my door<br />
    Hello, is it me you're looking for?<br />

  <div class="reff">
    <b>Reff I</b><br />
    I can see it in your eyes, I can see it in your smile<br />
    You're all I've ever wanted and my arms are open wide<br />
    'Cause you know just what to say, and you know just what to do<br />
    And I want to tell you so much, I love you<br />

  <div class="verse">
    I long to see the sunlight in your hair<br />
    And tell you time and time again how much I care<br />
    Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow<br />
    Hello, I've just got to let you know<br />
  </div>

  <div class="reff">
    <b>Reff II</b><br />
    'Cause I wonder where you are and I wonder what you do<br />
    Are you somewhere feeling lonely or is someone loving you?<br />
    Tell me how to win your heart, for I haven't got a clue<br />
    But let me start by saying, I love you <br />
