    I've been alone with you inside my mind<br />
    And in my dreams I've kissed<br />
    your lips a thousand times<br />
    I sometimes see you pass outside my door<br />
    Hello, is it me you're looking for?<br />

    I can see it in your eyes, <br />
    I can see it in your smile<br />
    You're all I've ever wanted and <br />
    my arms are open wide<br />
    <br />
    'Cause you know just what to say,<br />
    and you know just what to do<br />
    And I want to tell you so much,<br />
    I love you<br />

    I long to see the sunlight in your hair<br />
    And tell you time and time again <br />
    how much I care<br />
    Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow<br />
    Hello, I've just got to let you know<br />
  </div>

  <div class="reff">
    <b>Reff</b><br />
    'Cause I wonder where you are<br />
    and I wonder what you do<br />
    Are you somewhere feeling lonely <br />
    or is someone loving you?<br />
    <br />
    Tell me how to win your heart, <br />
    for I haven't got a clue<br />
    But let me start by saying,<br />
    I love you <br />
