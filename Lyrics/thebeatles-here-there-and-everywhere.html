          To lead a better life<br />
          I need my love to be here<br />
          <br />
          Here, making each day of the year<br />
          Changing my life with a wave of her hand <br />
          Nobody can deny that there's something there<br />
          <br />
          There, running my hands through her hair<br />
          Both of us thinking how good it can be<br />
          Someone is speaking<br />
          But she doesn't know he's there<br />
        </div>

        <div class="reff">
          <b>Reff</b><br />
          I want her everywhere<br />
          And if she's beside me I know I need never care<br />
          But to love her is to need her everywhere<br />
        </div>

        <div class="verse">
          Knowing that love is to share<br />
          Each one believing that love never dies<br />
          Watching their eyes and hoping I'm always there<br />
