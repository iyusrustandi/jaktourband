<div class="lyric">
  <div class="verse">
    To lead a better life<br />
    I need my love to be here<br />
    <br />
    Here, making each day of the year<br />
    Changing my life with a wave of her hand <br />
    Nobody can deny that there's something there<br />
    <br />
    There, running my hands through her hair<br />
    Both of us thinking how good it can be<br />
    Someone is speaking<br />
    But she doesn't know he's there<br />
  </div>

  <div class="reff">
    <b>Reff</b><br />
    I want her everywhere<br />
    And if she's beside me I know I need never care<br />
    But to love her is to need her everywhere<br />
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    Knowing that love is to share<br />
    Each one believing that love never dies<br />
    Watching their eyes and hoping I'm always there<br />
  </div>
