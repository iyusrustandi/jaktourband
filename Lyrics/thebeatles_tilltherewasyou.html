        <p>
            There were bells on a hill<br>
            But I never heard them ringing<br>
            No, I never heard them at all<br>
            'Til there was you<br>
        <br>
            There were birds in the sky<br>
            But I never saw them winging<br>
            No, I never saw them at all<br>
            'Til there was you<br>
        </p><br/><br>

        <div class="reff">
            <h4>Reff </h4>
            Then there was music<br>
            And wonderful roses<br>
            They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows<br>
            Of dawn and dew<br>
        </div><br/>

        <p>
            <h4>(*)</h4>
            There was love all around<br>
            But I never heard it singing<br>
            No, I never heard it at all<br>
            'Til there was you<br>
