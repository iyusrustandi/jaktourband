  <div class="verse">
    There were bells on a hill<br />
    But I never heard them ringing<br />
    No, I never heard them at all<br />
    'Til there was you<br />
    <br />
    There were birds in the sky<br />
    But I never saw them winging<br />
    No, I never saw them at all<br />
    'Til there was you<br />

  <div class="reff">
    <b>Reff </b><br />
    Then there was music<br />
    And wonderful roses<br />
    They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows<br />
    Of dawn and dew<br />
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    There was love all around<br />
    But I never heard it singing<br />
    No, I never heard it at all<br />
    'Til there was you<br />
