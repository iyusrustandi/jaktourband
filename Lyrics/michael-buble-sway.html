          When marimba rhythms start to play<br />
          Dance with me, make me sway<br />
          Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore<br />
          Hold me close, sway me more<br />
          <br />
          Like a flower bending in the breeze<br />
          Bend with me, sway with ease<br />
          When we dance, you have a way with me<br />
          Stay with me, sway with me<br />

          <b>Reff</b><br />
          Other dancers may be on the floor<br />
          Dear, but my eyes will see only you<br />
          Only you have that magic technique<br />
          When we sway, I go weak<br />

        <div class="verse">
          I can hear the sounds of violins<br />
          Long before it begins<br />
          Make me thrill as only you know how<br />
          Sway me smooth, sway me now<br />
