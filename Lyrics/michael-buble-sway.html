  <div class="verse">
    When marimba rhythms start to play<br />
    Dance with me, make me sway<br />
    Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore<br />
    Hold me close, sway me more<br />
    <br />
    Like a flower bending in the breeze<br />
    Bend with me, sway with ease<br />
    When we dance, you have a way with me<br />
    Stay with me, sway with me<br />
  </div>

  <div class="reff">
    <b>Reff</b><br />
    Other dancers may be on the floor<br />
    Dear, but my eyes will see only you<br />
    Only you have that magic technique<br />
    When we sway, I go weak<br />
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    I can hear the sounds of violins<br />
    Long before it begins<br />
    Make me thrill as only you know how<br />
    Sway me smooth, sway me now<br />
