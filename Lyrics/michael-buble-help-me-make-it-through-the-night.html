    Take that ribbon from your hair<br />
    Shake it loose and let it fall<br />
    Lay your head soft against your skin<br />
    Like the shadow on the wall<br />
    <br />
    <a style="color: #f637ce"><b>(Loren)</b><br /></a>
    Come and lay down by my side<br />
    Till the early morning light<br />
    All I'm taking is your time<br />
    Help me make it through the night<br />

    Yesterday is dead and gone<br />
    Yesterday is dead and gone<br />
    And tomorrow's out of sight<br />
    And tomorrow's out of sight<br />
    And it's sad to be alone<br />
    Help me make it through the night<br />
