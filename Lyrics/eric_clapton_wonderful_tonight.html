    It's late in the evening<br />
    She's wondering what clothes to wear<br />
    She puts on her make up<br />
    And brushes her long blonde hair<br />

    And then she asks me, "Do I look alright?"<br />
    And I say, "Yes, you look wonderful tonight"<br />

    We go to a party<br />
    And everyone turns to see<br />
    This beautiful lady<br />
    That's walking around with me<br />

    I feel wonderful<br />
    Because I see the love light in your eyes<br />
    And the wonder of it all<br />
    Is that you just don't realize how much I love you<br />

    It's time to go home now<br />
    And I've got an aching head<br />
    So I give her the car keys<br />
    She helps me to bed<br />
    <br />
    And then I tell her, as I turn out the light<br />
    I say, "My darling, you are wonderful tonight"<br />
    Oh my darling, you are wonderful tonight<br />
