    It's late in the evening<br />
    She's wondering what clothes to wear<br />
    She puts on her make up<br />
    And brushes her long blonde hair<br />

  <div class="reff">
    <b>Reff</b><br />
    And then she asks me,<br />
    Do I look alright?<br />
    And I say yes,<br />
    you look wonderful tonight<br />

    We go to a party<br />
    And everyone turns to see<br />
    This beautiful lady<br />
    That's walking around with me<br />
  </div>

  <div class="reff">
    <b>Reff</b><br />
    And then she asks me,<br />
    Do I look alright?<br />
    And I say yes,<br />
    you look wonderful tonight<br />
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    I feel wonderful<br />
    Because I see the love <br />
    light in your eyes<br />
    And the wonder of it all<br />
    Is that you just don't realize <br />
    how much I love you<br />

  <div class="verse">
    It's time to go home now<br />
    And I've got an aching head<br />
    So I give her the car keys<br />
    She helps me to bed<br />
  </div>

  <div class="reff">
    <b>Reff</b><br />
    And then I tell her,<br />
    as I turn out the light<br />
    I say, my darling, you are <br />
    wonderful tonight<br />
    Oh my darling, you are<br />
    wonderful tonight<br />
