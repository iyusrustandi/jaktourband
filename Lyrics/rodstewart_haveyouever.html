    Someone told me long ago<br />
    There's a calm before the storm<br />
    I know<br />
    It's been coming for some time <br />
    <br />
    When it's over so they say<br />
    It'll rain a sunny day<br />
    I know<br />
    Shining down like water<br />

    <b>Reff</b><br />
    I want to know<br />
    Have you ever seen the rain<br />
    I want to know<br />
    Have you ever seen the rain<br />
    Coming down on a sunny day <br /><br />
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    Yesterday and days before<br />
    Sun is cold and rain is hard<br />
    I know<br />
    Been that way for all my time<br />
    <br />
    'Til forever on it goes<br />
    Through the circle, fast and slow<br />
    I know<br />
    It can't stop, I wonder <br />
