    How can I say to you<br />
    I love somebody new<br />
    You were so good to me, always<br />
    <br />
    And when I see your eyes<br />
    I can't go on with lie<br />
    It breaks your heart,<br />
    But I just can't hide it... Oh, no.<br />

    No, I can't be so strong<br />

    Don't look that way to me<br />
    It hurts you, so I see<br />

    I may be wrong<br />
    But I better go now... Oh, no<br />
