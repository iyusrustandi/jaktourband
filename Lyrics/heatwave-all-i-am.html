Who do you think you see
When you look at me
Is it somebody strong
Somebody you could admire

And who do you think I am
when I take your hand
Are you counting on me
To fill your dreams
and your desires

Well all I am
is lonely just like you
All I wanna do
is have one dream comes true
All I am
is handing you my heart
hoping to be part of you

Who do you think you are
Standing in the dark
Are you waiting for me
Why can't I reach you from here

oh, how do I get to you
won't you let me through
don't you think that may   
we have something special 
to be shared
