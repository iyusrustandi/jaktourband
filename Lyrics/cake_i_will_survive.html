  <div class="verse">
    At first I was afraid<br />
    I was petrified<br />
    I kept thinking I could never live without you<br />
    By my side<br />
    <br />
    But then I spent so many nights<br />
    Just thinking how you've done me wrong<br />
    I grew strong<br />
    I learned how to get along<br />
    <br />
    And so you're back<br />
    From outer space<br />
    I just walked in to find you<br />
    Here with that look upon your face<br />
    <br />
    I should have changed my fucking lock<br />
    I would have made you leave your key<br />
    If I had known for just one second<br />
    You'd be back to bother me<br />

    Oh now go<br />
    Walk out the door<br />
    Just turn around<br />
    Now, you're not welcome anymore<br />
    <br />
    Weren't you the one<br />
    Who tried to break me with desire?<br />
    Did you think I'd crumble?<br />
    Did you think I'd lay down and die? <br />
    <br />
    Oh not I, I will survive<br />
    Yeah<br />
    As Long as I know how to love<br />
    I know I'll be alive
    <br />
    I've got all my life to live<br />
    I've got all my love to give<br />
    I will survive, I will survive<br />
    Yeah, yeah<br />

    It took all the strength I had<br />
    Just not to fall apart<br />
    I'm trying hard to mend the pieces<br />
    Of my broken heart<br />
    <br />
    And I spent oh so many nights<br />
    Just feeling sorry for myself<br />
    I used to cry<br />
    But now I hold my head up high<br />
    <br />
    And you see me<br />
    With somebody new<br />
    I'm not that stupid little person<br />
    Still in love with you<br />
    <br />
    And so you thought you'd just drop by<br />
    And you expect me to be free<br />
    But now I'm saving all my lovin'<br />
    For someone who's lovin' me<br />
