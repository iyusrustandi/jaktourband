        <div class="verse">
          At first I was afraid<br />
          I was petrified<br />
          I kept thinking I could never live without you<br />
          By my side<br />
          <br />
          But then I spent so many nights<br />
          Just thinking how you've done me wrong<br />
          I grew strong<br />
          I learned how to get along<br />
          <br />
          And so you're back<br />
          From outer space<br />
          I just walked in to find you<br />
          Here with that look upon your face<br />
          <br />
          I should have changed my fucking lock<br />
          I would have made you leave your key<br />
          If I had known for just one second<br />
          You'd be back to bother me<br />

        <div class="reff">
          <b>Reff</b><br />
          Oh now go<br />
          Walk out the door<br />
          Just turn around<br />
          Now, you're not welcome anymore<br />
          <br />
          Weren't you the one<br />
          Who tried to break me with desire?<br />
          Did you think I'd crumble?<br />
          Did you think I'd lay down and die? <br />
          <br />
          Oh not I, I will survive<br />
          Yeah<br />
          As Long as I know how to love<br />
          I know I'll be alive
          <br />
          I've got all my life to live<br />
          I've got all my love to give<br />
          I will survive, I will survive<br />
          Yeah, yeah<br />

        <div class="verse">
          It took all the strength I had<br />
          Just not to fall apart<br />
          I'm trying hard to mend the pieces<br />
          Of my broken heart<br />
          <br />
          And I spent oh so many nights<br />
          Just feeling sorry for myself<br />
          I used to cry<br />
          But now I hold my head up high<br />
          <br />
          And you see me<br />
          With somebody new<br />
          I'm not that stupid little person<br />
          Still in love with you<br />
          <br />
          And so you thought you'd just drop by<br />
          And you expect me to be free<br />
          But now I'm saving all my lovin'<br />
          For someone who's lovin' me<br />
