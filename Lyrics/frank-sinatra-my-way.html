        <p>
          And now, the end is near<br />
          And so I face the final curtain<br />
          My friends, I'll say it clear<br />
          I'll state my case of which I'm certain<br />
          <br />
          I've lived a life that's full <br />
          I've travelled each and every highway<br />
          And more, much more than this<br />
          I did it my way<br />
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          Regrets? I've had a few<br />
          But then again, too few to mention<br />
          I did what I had to do<br />
          And saw it through without exemption<br />
          <br />
          I planned each charted course <br />
          Each careful step along the byway<br />
          And more, much more than this<br />
          I did it my way<br />
        </p>
        <br /><br />

        <div class="reff">
          <h4>Reff</h4>
          Yes, there were times I'm sure you knew<br />
          When I bit off more than I could chew<br />
          But through it all, when there was doubt<br />
          I ate it up and spit it out<br />
          I faced it all and I stood tall <br />
          and did it my way<br />
        </div>
        <br /><br />

        <p>
          I've loved, I've laughed and cried,<br />
          I've had my fill - my share of losing<br />
          And now, as tears subside<br />
          I find it all so amusing<br />
          <br />
          To think I did all that<br />
          And may I say, not in a shy way<br />
          Oh no. Oh no, not me<br />
          I did it my way<br />
        </p>
        <br /><br />

        <div class="reff">
          <h4>Reff</h4>
          For what is a man? What has he got?<br />
          If not himself - Then he has naught<br />
          To say the things he truly feels<br />
          And not the words of one who kneels<br />
          The record shows I took the blows<br />
          And did it my way<br />
          <br />
          Yes, it was my way<br />
        </div>
        <br /><br />
      </div>
    </div>
