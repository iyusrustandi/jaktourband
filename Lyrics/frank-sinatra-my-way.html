    And now, the end is near<br />
    And so I face the final curtain<br />
    My friends, I'll say it clear<br />
    I'll state my case of which I'm certain<br />
    <br />
    I've lived a life that's full <br />
    I've travelled each and every highway<br />
    And more, much more than this<br />
    I did it my way<br />
    <br />
    Regrets? I've had a few<br />
    But then again, too few to mention<br />
    I did what I had to do<br />
    And saw it through without exemption<br />
    <br />
    I planned each charted course <br />
    Each careful step along the byway<br />
    And more, much more than this<br />
    I did it my way<br />

    <h4>Reff</h4>
    Yes, there were times I'm sure you knew<br />
    When I bit off more than I could chew<br />
    But through it all, when there was doubt<br />
    I ate it up and spit it out<br />
    I faced it all and I stood tall <br />
    and did it my way<br />
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    I've loved, I've laughed and cried,<br />
    I've had my fill - my share of losing<br />
    And now, as tears subside<br />
    I find it all so amusing<br />
    <br />
    To think I did all that<br />
    And may I say, not in a shy way<br />
    Oh no. Oh no, not me<br />
    I did it my way<br />
  </div>

  <div class="reff">
    <h4>Reff</h4>
    For what is a man? What has he got?<br />
    If not himself - Then he has naught<br />
    To say the things he truly feels<br />
    And not the words of one who kneels<br />
    The record shows I took the blows<br />
    And did it my way<br />
    <br />
    Yes, it was my way<br />
