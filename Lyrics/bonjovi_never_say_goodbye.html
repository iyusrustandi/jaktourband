    As I sit in this smokey room<br />
    The night about to end<br />
    I pass my time with strangers<br />
    But this bottle's my only friend <br />
    <br />
    Rememberin' when we used to park<br />
    On Butler Street, out in the dark<br />
    Remember when we lost the keys and<br />
    You lost more than that in my backseat, baby <br />
    <br />
    Remember how we used to talk<br />
    About busting out, we'd break their hearts<br />
    Together, forever<br />

    Never say goodbye<br />
    Never say goodbye<br />
    You and me and my old friends<br />
    Hoping it would never end <br />
    <br />
    Say goodbye<br />
    Never say goodbye<br />
    Holdin' on, we've gotta try<br />
    Holdin' on to never say goodbye <br />

  <div class="verse">
    Remember days of skipping school<br />
    Racing cars and being cool<br />
    With a six pack and the radio<br />
    We didn't need no place to go <br />
    <br />
    Remember at the prom that night<br />
    You and me, we had a fight<br />
    But the band they played our favorite song<br />
    And I held you in my arms so strong <br />
    <br />
    We danced so close<br />
    We danced so slow<br />
    And I swore I'd never let you go<br />
    Together, forever <br />
