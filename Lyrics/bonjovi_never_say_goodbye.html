         <p>
        As I sit in this smokey room<br>
        The night about to end<br>
        I pass my time with strangers<br>
        But this bottle's my only friend   <br> 
        <br>
        Rememberin' when we used to park<br>
        On Butler Street, out in the dark<br>
        Remember when we lost the keys and<br>
        You lost more than that in my backseat, baby   <br> 
        <br>
        Remember how we used to talk<br>
        About busting out, we'd break their hearts<br>
        Together, forever<br>
      </p><br /><br/>

       <div class="reff">
        <b>Reff</b><br/>
        Never say goodbye<br>
        Never say goodbye<br>
        You and me and my old friends<br>
        Hoping it would never end   <br>
        <br>
        Say goodbye<br>
        Never say goodbye<br>
        Holdin' on, we've gotta try<br>
        Holdin' on to never say goodbye   <br>

        <p>
        Remember days of skipping school<br>
        Racing cars and being cool<br>
        With a six pack and the radio<br>
        We didn't need no place to go   <br>
        <br>
        Remember at the prom that night<br>
        You and me, we had a fight<br>
        But the band they played our favorite song<br>
        And I held you in my arms so strong    <br> 
        <br>
        We danced so close<br>
        We danced so slow<br>
        And I swore I'd never let you go<br>
        Together, forever      <br>        
      </p><br /><br/>

        <b>Bridge</b><br/>
        Oh, and I guess you'd say<br>
        We used to talk about busting out<br>
        We'd break their hearts<br>
        Together, forever      <br>
