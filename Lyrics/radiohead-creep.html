    When you were here before<br />
    Couldn't look you in the eye<br />
    You're just like an angel<br />
    Your skin makes me cry<br />
    <br />
    You float like a feather<br />
    In a beautiful world<br />
    I wish I was special<br />
    You're so fuckin' special<br />

  <div class="verse">
    I don't care if it hurts<br />
    I wanna have control<br />
    I want a perfect body<br />
    I want a perfect soul<br />

    I want you to notice<br />
    When I'm not around<br />
    So fuckin' special<br />
    I wish I was special<br />
