        Sorry seems to be the hardest word<br>
        <br>
       What I got to do to make you love me?<br>
        What I got to do to make you care?<br>
        What do I do when lightning strikes me?<br>
        And I wake to find that you're not there?<br>
      </p><br />
        <p>
        <h4>(*)</h4>
       What I got to do to make you want me?<br>
        What I got to do to be heard?<br>
        What do I say when it's all over?<br>
        Sorry seems to be the hardest word<br>
      </p><br /><br/>

       <div class="reff">
        <h4>Reff</h4>
       It's sad, so sad<br>
        It's a sad, sad situation<br>
        And it's getting more and more absurd<br>
        <br>
        It's sad, so sad<br>
        Why can't we talk it over?<br>
        Oh, it seems to me<br>
        That sorry seems to be the hardest word<br>

        What do I do when lightning strikes me?<br>
        What have I got to do?<br>
        What have I got to do?<br>
