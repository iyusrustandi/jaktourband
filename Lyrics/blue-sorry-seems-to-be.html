    Sorry seems to be the hardest word<br />

    What I got to do to make you love me?<br />
    What I got to do to make you care?<br />
    What do I do when lightning strikes me?<br />
    And I wake to find that you're not there?<br />
    <br />
    What I got to do to make you want me?<br />
    What I got to do to be heard?<br />
    What do I say when it's all over?<br />
    Sorry seems to be the hardest word<br />

    It's a sad, sad situation<br />
    And it's getting more and more absurd<br />
    <br />
