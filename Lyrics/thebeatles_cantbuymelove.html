    Can't buy me love, love<br />
    Can't buy me love <br />
    <br />
    I'll buy you a diamond ring my friend<br />
    If it makes you feel alright<br />
    I'll get you anything my friend<br />
    If it makes you feel alright<br />
    'Cause I don't care too much for money<br />
    For money can't buy me love<br />
    <br />
    I'll give you all I've got to give<br />
    If you say you love me too<br />
    I may not have a lot to give<br />
    But what I've got, I'll give to you<br />
    I don't care too much for money<br />
    Money can't buy me love <br />

    Say you don't need no diamond ring<br />
    And I'll be satisfied<br />

    I don't care too much for money<br />
    Money can't buy me love <br />
