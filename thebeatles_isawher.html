            Well, she was just seventeen<br>
            You know what I mean<br>
            And the way she looked<br>
            Was way beyond compare<br>
            <br>
            So how could I dance with another<br>
            Ooh, when I saw her standing there?<br>
        </p><br/>
        <p>
            Well, she looked at me<br>
            And I, I could see<br>
            That before too long<br>
            I'd fall in love with her<br>
            <br>
            She wouldn't dance with another<br>
            Ooh, when I saw her standing there<br>
        </p><br/>
        <p>
            <h4>Reff</h4>
            Well, my heart went "boom"<br>
            When I crossed that room<br>
            And I held her hand in mine<br>
        </p><br/><br/>
        <p>
            Oh we danced through the night<br>
            And we held each other tight<br>
            And before too long<br>
            I fell in love with her<br>
            <br>
            Now I'll never dance with another<br>
            Ooh, since I saw her standing there   <br>
        </p><br/>

            Oh, we danced through the night<br>
            And we held each other tight<br>
            And before too long<br>
            I fell in love with her<br>
            Now I'll never dance with another<br>
            Oh, since I saw her standing there<br>
            Oh, since I saw her standing there<br>
            Yeah, well since I saw her standing there<br>
