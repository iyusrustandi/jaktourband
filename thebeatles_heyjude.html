    <h2>The Beatles - Hey Jude</h2>
    <div class="lyric">
        <p>
            Hey Jude, don't make it bad.<br>
            Take a sad song and make it better.<br>
            Remember to let her into your heart,<br>
            Then you can start to make it better. <br>
        </p><br/>
        <p>
            Hey Jude, don't be afraid.<br>
            You were made to go out and get her.<br>
            The minute you let her under your skin,<br>
            Then you begin to make it better.<br>
        </p><br/>
        <p>
            <h4>Reff</h4>
            And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain,<br>
            Don't carry the world upon your shoulders.<br>
            For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool<br>
            By making his world a little colder.<br>
        </p><br/>
        <p><h4>Break</h4></p><br />
        <p>
            Hey Jude, don't let me down.<br>
            You have found her, now go and get her.<br>
            Remember to let her into your heart,<br>
            Then you can start to make it better.<br>
        </p><br/>
        <p>
            <h4>Reff</h4>
            So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin,<br>
            You're waiting for someone to perform with.<br>
            And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do,<br>
            The movement you need is on your shoulder.            <br>
        </p><br/>
        <p><h4>Break</h4></p><br />
        <p>
            Hey Jude, don't make it bad.<br>
            Take a sad song and make it better.<br>
            Remember to let her under your skin,<br>
            Then you'll begin to make it<br>
            Better better better better better better, oh.<br>
        </p><br/>
        <p><h4>Coda</h4></p><br />
