        <p><h4>Intro</h4><br /></p>
        <p>
            <h4>(*)</h4>
            Have I told you lately that I love you<br>
            Have I told you there's no one else above you<br>
            You fill my heart with gladness<br>
            Take away all my sadness<br>
            Ease my troubles, that's what you do<br>
        </p><br/>
        <p>
            <h4>(**)</h4>
            For the morning sun and all it's glory<br>
            Greets the day with hope and comfort, too<br>
            You fill my life with laughter<br>
            And somehow, you make it better<br>
            Ease my troubles, that's what you do<br>
        </p><br/>
        <p>
            <h4>Reff</h4>
            There's a love that's divine<br>
            And it's yours and it's mine<br>
            Like the sun<br>
            And at the end of the day<br>
            We should give thanks and pray<br>
            To the one, to the one<br>
        </p><br/>

        <p>
          And have I told you lately that I love you<br>
          Have I told you there's no one else above you<br>
          You fill my heart with gladness<br>
          Take away all my sadness<br>
          Ease my troubles, that's what you do<br>
        </p><br/>
        <p>
          Take away all my sadness, fill my life with gladness<br>
          Ease my troubles, that's what you do<br>
          Take away all my sadness, fill my life with gladness<br>
          Ease my troubles, that's what you do<br>
