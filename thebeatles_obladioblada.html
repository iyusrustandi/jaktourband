        <p>
            Desmond has a barrow in the market place<br>
            Molly is the singer in a band<br>
            Desmond says to Molly, "Girl, I like your face"<br>
            And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand<br>
        </p><br/>
        <p>
            <h4>Reff </h4>
            Ob-la-di ob-la-da life goes on bra<br>
            La-la how their life goes on<br>
            Ob-la-di ob-la-da life goes on bra<br>
            La-la how their life goes on<br>
        </p><br/><br/>
        <p>
            Desmond takes a trolley to the jeweler's stores<br>
            Buys a twenty carat golden ring (Golden ring?)<br>
            Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door<br>
            And as he gives it to her she begins to sing (Sing)<br>
        </p><br/>
        <p>Back To : <b>Reff</b></p><br/>
        <p>
            <h4>Bridge</h4>
            In a couple of years they have built<br>
            A home sweet home<br>
            With a couple of kids running in the yard<br>
            Of Desmond and Molly Jones<br>
            (Ah ha ha ha ha ha) <br>  
        </p><br/>
        <p>
            <h4>(*)</h4>
            Happy ever after in the market place<br>
            Desmond lets the children lend a hand (Arm! Leg!)<br>
            Molly stays at home and does her pretty face<br>
            And in the evening she still sings it with the band <br>         
        </p><br/>
        <p>Back To : <b>Reff, Bridge, (*), Reff</b></p><br/>
